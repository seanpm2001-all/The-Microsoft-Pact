# The Microsoft pact

**This document is not ready yet.**

I am against a lot of corporations. I can’t be enemies with everyone, and I had to pick 1 corp to befriend. I chose Microsoft. Microsoft seemed the least evil in several ways, and I owe a lot to them, such as my introduction to computing, many, many parts of my childhood and beginning of programming, and more. Although I can’t stand Windows 10, the pact is still there. Microsoft is spared.

| Enemies | Still an enemy          | Reason |
| ------- | ------------------ |-----------------|
| Google  | :white_check_mark: | Various, see [DeGoogle your Life](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Degoogle-your-life/) |
| Amazon  | :white_check_mark: | Various |
| Facebook  | :white_check_mark: | Various |
| TenCent  | :white_check_mark: | Various |
| Apple | :x: | Neutral |
| Valve  | :x: | Neutral |

| Spared | Still friendly with          | Reason |
| ------- | ------------------ |-----------------|
| Microsoft | :white_check_mark: | The Microsoft Pact, introduction to computing |
| Mozilla | :white_check_mark: | Various |
| Red Hat | :white_check_mark: | Various |
| Canonical | :white_check_mark: | Various |

I also have to do this, since Microsoft now owns GitHub, my main means of production. Under this compromise, I am still free to criticize Microsoft, as like anyone else, but I can’t do anything to make their services decremented, other than services I have strong disagreements with, which include Windows, Microsoft Office, and Surface.

I can still criticize other services, even GitHub and Bing, but the criticism must be highly constructive. I must not mention Microsofts involvement in the PRISM program. I can mention Microsofts past attempts to destroy Linux, but it must be done in retrospect, and it must be mentioned that Microsoft backpedaled on this.

I support the past Scroogled campaign, and I support Fluent Design, as it is so much better than flat design or material design.

## Exceptions

If Microsoft terminates my GitHub account, locks me out, or hinders functionality to the point where normal use is not possible, the pact will end.
